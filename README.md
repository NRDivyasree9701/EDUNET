AUTO-AI Project with Framingham Heart Study Dataset:
The Heart Study Dataset is commonly used in medical research, especially for cardiovascular risk analysis and prediction. Several versions of heart-related datasets are available, with the most popular being the Framingham Heart Study Dataset and other similar datasets. These datasets often include medical and lifestyle data that help researchers develop models for predicting heart disease risks.

Hereâ€™s a general overview of what you might find in a heart study dataset:

Common Features in Heart Datasets:
Age: The age of the patient.
Gender: Typically male or female.
Chest pain type: Different types of chest pain indicating angina or other heart conditions.
Resting blood pressure: Blood pressure at rest.
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
Fasting blood sugar: Whether fasting blood sugar is above or below a certain level (e.g., 120 mg/dl).
Resting ECG results: Results of electrocardiograms.
Maximum heart rate achieved: During physical exercise.
Exercise-induced angina: Whether angina was induced during exercise.
Oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
Thalassemia: Condition related to blood disorder, often noted as "normal," "fixed defect," or "reversible defect."
Smoking habits: Indicates whether the person is a smoker.
Diabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes.
Family history of heart disease: Indicates if heart disease runs in the family.
Target: Whether the patient has heart disease or not (often used as the dependent variable for predictions).
